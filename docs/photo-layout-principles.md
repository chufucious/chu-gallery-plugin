## Keith Smith — Structure of the Visual Book

Keith A. Smith (b. 1938) is a pioneering book artist who has created 300+ artist's books and authored eight foundational texts on book structure. His *Structure of the Visual Book* is the definitive guide to conceiving visual books as unified experiences.

### Core Philosophy

> "I had to use books because it would allow me to have flow and movement. I am not interested in the single pictures, I am interested in the totality of the thing."

> "The individual pages have to give up their independence in order to form a union."

> "Many people take great pains to compose the individual pictures contained in a book, but often neglect to compose the book. A realized book is a single experience."

### Group, Series, and Sequence

Smith's central framework distinguishes three modes of image organization:

| Mode | Definition | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Group** | Images that share a common characteristic but have no particular order | Collections, portfolios |
| **Series** | Images with a logical progression (temporal, spatial, thematic) | Documentary, journeys |
| **Sequence** | Images where order creates meaning; each depends on its neighbors | Narrative, visual argument |

These are "the means of pacing and orchestrating the book."

### Time and Pacing

> "Just as poetry and cinema are conceived in time, so is a book."

- Page turning creates rhythm and pacing
- The book is a time-based medium—the viewer's experience unfolds sequentially
- Content and structure must be "integrated completely"

### The Book as Visual Object

Smith approaches books not through decoration but through understanding structure:
- The book format offers "unique opportunities for creating visual space that can't be created in other mediums"
- The codex, accordion, and hybrid structures each enable different reading experiences
- Physical construction (binding, paper, format) should serve the conceptual intent

### Musical Influence

> "Music, especially sonatas, symphonies, and Richard Wagner's leitmotifs, were my only influences, not photographers."

Smith applies musical composition principles:
- Movements and variations
- Recurring motifs (leitmotifs)
- Dynamic contrast (crescendo/diminuendo)
- Rests and pauses

## Jörg Colberg — Understanding Photobooks

Dr. Jörg M. Colberg runs Conscientious Photography Magazine (cphmag.com) and teaches at Hartford Art School's photobook-focused MFA program. His *Understanding Photobooks* (2016) covers concept, editing, sequencing, design, and production.

### On Editing

> "The problem with photographers is that they love their photographs too much. When you make a photobook you need to be ruthless. You might love a certain photo the most, but if it doesn't fit into the book, then it doesn't fit into the book. Period."

**The Wall Method:**
- Pin all photos on a wall
- Live with them for a while
- Some will come down; some may return
- Let the edit reveal itself over time

### On Sequencing

> "The starting point has to be the concept for your book."

Before arranging images, clarify:
- What is the book about?
- What is its intended purpose?
- How will readers interact with it? (linear, random, reference)

**Physical Mock-up Method:**
1. Get a blank notebook and double-sided tape
2. Print images cheaply (4×6")
3. Arrange them in the notebook
4. Change the sequence easily by removing/moving prints
5. "You literally get a real book—it will feel like a real book"

> "A lot of people design their books on a computer. That works up to a certain point, but eventually you will have to print things out and make a book to see whether it really works."

### Two Modes of Sequencing

| Mode | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **Narrative** | Order matters; images must be seen in sequence to build meaning |
| **Showcase** | Order is based on visual criteria; no strict narrative dependency |

### On Collaboration

> "You're almost always better off involving other people. Maybe you're a genius, maybe you can do it all on your own. Chances are you are not."

- Find someone to help with editing and sequencing
- "A bad or lousy edit and/or sequence will ruin your book"
- Work with a designer—"photobooks made with the involvement of a designer simply make for much better books"

### Key Design Considerations

- **Spreads are the fundamental unit**: Images can repeat or contrast in subject, graphical elements, emotion, or composition
- **The gutter as design element**: The central binding functions as a strong vertical line that can deliberately slice images
- **Pacing through rhythm**: Vary intensity between quiet passages and dramatic crescendos
- **Develop separate rhythms**: Left and right pages can have their own patterns, converging strategically

### Understanding Bindings

Different bindings affect the reading experience:
- Perfect binding: pages curl at gutter
- Sewn binding: lies flatter
- Layflat: no gutter—seamless spreads
- Accordion: can be read as sequence or displayed as panorama

## John Szarkowski — The Photographer's Eye & Curatorial Vision

John Szarkowski (1925–2007) directed MoMA's photography department from 1962–1991, curating 160+ exhibitions and launching careers of Arbus, Eggleston, Friedlander, Winogrand. His frameworks remain foundational.

### Core Insight

> "Photography provided a radically new picture-making process—a process based not on synthesis but on selection."

Unlike painting, photographs are taken from reality, not constructed. The photographer must "see not simply the reality before him but the still invisible picture."

### The Five Characteristics (from *The Photographer's Eye*, 1966)

#### 1. The Thing Itself

- Photography deals with the actual and must treasure this factuality
- The photograph and reality are different—much filters out in the static image
- The camera's credibility creates authority: "what it saw a photograph of was true"

#### 2. The Detail

- Photographers isolate fragments and claim special significance through them
- Photography naturally resists narrative; it excels at revealing the symbolic
- Robert Capa's rule: "If your pictures aren't good enough you're not close enough"
- Details function as interpretive clues, enabling viewers to complete narratives themselves

#### 3. The Frame

> "The central act of photography is the act of choosing and eliminating, forcing a concentration on the picture edge."

- The frame's edges are cropping devices, not natural boundaries
- Minute shifts fundamentally alter relationships between elements
- The world appears "like a scroll painting, unrolled from hand to hand, exhibiting an infinite number of croppings"
- **The frame constructs meaning**

#### 4. Time

- Every photograph describes "a discrete parcel of time"
- Photography captures only the present; past and future exist only as relics or prophecy
- Photographers discovered beauty in "fragmenting of time"—momentary patterning of lines and shapes
- Cartier-Bresson's "decisive moment" is visual, not narrative: "not a story but a picture"
- Various temporal treatments (blurs, sequences, long exposures) organize time itself

#### 5. Vantage Point

> "Shooting from high above, low to the ground, up close, or far away is not just for visual novelty; it is a redistribution of power and relationships."

- An aerial view turns people into geography
- A close-up turns an object into a body
- Changing vantage point can refresh a subject more effectively than changing equipment
- Unexpected angles reveal "what previously took the photograph to reveal"

### Windows and Mirrors (from 1978 MoMA exhibition)

Szarkowski's second framework classifies photographic approaches:

| Windows (Realist) | Mirrors (Romantic) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Direct observation of external world | Introspective narrative reflecting inner vision |
| Discoverable patterns of intrinsic meaning | Intense sensitivity to mystical content |
| Photographer as discoverer | Photographer as creator |
| Interest in "man as a social animal" | Minimal interest in social documentation |
| Example: Robert Frank | Example: Minor White |

> "Photographers are not purely realistic or romantic, but some blend of these, somewhere on the pendulum as it swings back and forth."

### On Curation

The pictures in his collections "have in fact little in common except their success, and a shared vocabulary." His five characteristics are "interdependent aspects of a single problem" and "section views through the body of photographic tradition."

## Nathan Lyons — Extended Sequence

Nathan Lyons (1930–2016) founded Visual Studies Workshop and pioneered the extended photographic sequence. His *Notations in Passing* (1974) established principles of visual juxtaposition.

### Core Philosophy

> "If metaphor is a verbal strategy to evoke images, then as a photographer I'm interested in combining images to alter associations by extending the image itself. A juxtaposition of images enhances this possibility, while an extended sequence of images establishes a highly interactive structure that does not simply identify objects or events in a narrative sense but transforms the meaning of objects."

### Five Layers of Visual Book Meaning

1. **Context** — The frame of reference and setting
2. **Order** — Sequence and arrangement
3. **Juxtaposition** — Relationship between adjacent images
4. **Symbols** — Visual signs and their associations
5. **Physical characteristics** — Material qualities of the book itself

### Diptych Thinking

- Lyons mounted images in pairs in a single mat for exhibition
- Extended sequences are built from paired relationships
- Juxtaposition creates meaning that neither image possesses alone

## Practical Sequencing Principles

### Narrative Structures

| Structure | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Flat** | Linear, reference-style; images as collection | Portfolios, catalogs |
| **Arc** | Todorov model: equilibrium → disruption → recognition → restoration → new equilibrium | Documentary, story |
| **Cluster** | Thematic chapters; sections work independently and together | Essays, complex topics |
| **Scatter** | Viewers create connections; aesthetic pairings guide interpretation | Experimental, poetic |

### Building Connections

Visual connections form through:
- Identical or similar subjects
- Repeated graphical elements (lines, shapes, tones)
- Sequential narrative logic
- Subject containment (eye → face, detail → whole)
- Emotional resonance

### Pacing Techniques

- **Rests**: Blank pages or full-bleed images that pause the rhythm
- **Motifs**: Recurring visual elements that anchor the reader
- **Crescendo/Diminuendo**: Vary intensity; don't sustain climax indefinitely
- **Spreading time**: Control time spent per spread through image density

### Evans-Style Sequencing

Named after Walker Evans, this approach creates "graphical reference to the previous" image:
- Elements like lines, positions, or subjects echo across pages
- Maintains forward momentum while building coherent design

### The Working Backwards Method

> "Pick the image on which you want to end your edit, and then keep adding from there, building your story from the conclusion to the introduction."

Avoids linear traps; helps identify the emotional destination first.

### Physical Layout Considerations

| Element | Principle |
|---------|-----------|
| **Spread** | The fundamental unit; design for two-page view |
| **Gutter** | Can slice images deliberately; avoid placing faces/text here |
| **Bleed** | Extend images 1/8" beyond trim for full-bleed; keep important content 1/4" from edges |
| **White space** | Functions as visual punctuation; gives readers breathing room |

### The 75-from-250 Rule

For a photobook of ~75 images:
- Start with 250+ potential images
- Edit ruthlessly to ~100
- Sequence down to ~75 final selections

> "A realized book is a single experience."

**Jörg Colberg:**
> "If it doesn't fit into the book, then it doesn't fit into the book. Period."

**John Szarkowski:**
> "The central act of photography is the act of choosing and eliminating."

**Nathan Lyons:**
> "A juxtaposition of images... transforms the meaning of objects."

**Gerry Badger:**
> "Sequencing the photobook is not a science, it's an art. It's like making an abstract painting, a matter of intuitive trial and error."
